# Decompilation of `bluemarinefoundation.com`

## Credits

Original work: [Blue Marine Foundation website](https://bluemarinefoundation.com), developped by [Unseen Studio](https://unseen.co/).

This project leans heavily on [this livestream by Yuri Artiukh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D-J_Lbxeeg), where he decompiles the shader effects.

The project setup is based on [this template by Bruno Simon](https://github.com/brunosimon/threejs-template-complex). I have extended it slightly for my convenience.

## Local setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server
npm run dev

# Build for production into the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
